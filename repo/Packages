Description: Noctis Glases is an additional free Addon for Noctis! It can be used without the 'DarkMode' but to install this Add-On you must purchase Noctis first. This Add-On (when enabled) turns off the blur from Dock, Notifications, Widgets, Spotlight Search, Folder Icons, 3D Touch, Dialer, Call Screen so Noctis has a clean look on your iDevice. (Added all three modes to Widgets, Dock.. etc)
